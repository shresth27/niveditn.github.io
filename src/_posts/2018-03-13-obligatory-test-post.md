Testing blog posts the old fashioned way, by writing a bunch of words about nothing at all so that I can see the changes update in my real site. I can include details about a few things I care about like:

- `code`
- Games
- Books

{% highlight javascript %}
const honorific = ['Lt.', 'Dr.'];
const li = "Liara T'Soni";
const dialogue = `Hello, ${honorific[1]} ${li}!`;
console.log(dialogue);
// prints "Hello, Dr. Liara T'Soni!" to console.
{% endhighlight %}
